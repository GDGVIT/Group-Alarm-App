# Group-Alarm-App

Ever been woken up by a 6:00 AM alarm even when youâ€™re at home on vacation? We at DSC VIT knows how frustrating the alarm blues can be during vacation time, so we built OneAlarm, a one of its kind app that lets you group your alarms under desired groups!

Letâ€™s say your college classes demand that you wake up at 7:00 AM on Monday, 8:00 AM on Tuesday, 7:30 AM on Wednesday... you get the drift! You can sort all of the alarms under day wise groups and turn all of these groups off once youâ€™re at home where you lead an alarm-free life!

Benefits of OneAlarm
*No need to turn all those 13 alarms everytime you go to sleep. Single tap and you can switch on/off.
*No limit on number of groups and alarms.
*An interactive and clean UI.
*Simple life ðŸ˜„

Youâ€™ll never be late for a class again unless of course, the snooze button is an old pal of yours! Let DSC VITâ€™s OneAlarm be the solution to all your punctuality woes.
